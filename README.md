# Algorithms Project #2 - Convex Hull Analysis
##**Description**
- This program computes the convex hull using three
  different algorithms (Graham Scan, Jarvis March, QuickHull)  

##**How to Run**  
- Create a file containing points  
- These points should be in the form of 'x(tab key)y(new line)'
- To compute the convex hull, run the program by typing:  
- 'adrobnjak_2.exe (type of algorithm) (file containing data)'  
  where type of algorithm can be = 'Q', 'J', or 'G' (QuickHull, Jarvis March, and Graham Scan)
- Once ran, the program will generate a list of points and output it to a file 
  with the name of 'hull_(type of algorithm).txt'
  where type of algorithm can be = 'Q', 'J', or 'G' (QuickHull, Jarvis March, and Graham Scan)  
- To do empirical analysis on the algorithms, uncomment the clock code, which will then also
  output how long it took to run each algorithm
